    <hr>
    <p style="color:black;"> I think its the combination of story and visuals along with characterization.
The combination of story and visuals allows for a visual stimulation and something to follow along with. This allows for us to grow connections and attachments to the game we are playing and this also allows for characterization to flourish and enrich the story.</p>

Games also provide a sense of reward, usually with games come rewards that entice a gamer further.

	  <p style="color:black;">Overall I agree with the review and the order in which he ranked the season however there are some of his opinions I don't completely agree with some of his opinions on the seasons themselves. He points out that one of the reasons he ranked season 3 the worst is because of the art style and coloring change but I actually think this is a positive when it comes to season three and its production.</p>

Based on each person's life and personal preferences each computer might have its own pros and cons. Based on the article I would have to pick a desktop. The desktop's main pro is the high definition and great quality. While most make their inability to be mobile a con, I consider it a fair price to pay for the higher definition and quality.</h3>

      <h3 class="sectionContentSubTitle">&nbsp;I would rather be playing the walking dead over call of duty 
        My favorite game of all time is the walking dead 
        I think what makes the game so good is that its characters are intriguing and match so well with the story. The characters inhance the story and you really care about them as the story progresses. according to steam the game has a perfect rating of 10 stars. I would personally rate the game at a 8/9 because although it is one of my favorite games, i fell like some things could have been better and certain plots could have been more explored.&nbsp;</h3>
