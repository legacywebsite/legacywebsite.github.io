      <h2 class="sectionContentTitle">&nbsp;</h2>
      <h3 class="sectionContentSubTitle">&nbsp;1. Finding/ making a shelter is the first step because it is the most important step. When you first enter the Minecraft world you have about 15 minutes to create or find a sustainable shelter for you to live in This can be as simple as finding a cave or maybe even a village. However, building your own shelter could be as easy as digging a hole in the ground and remaining there until morning.&nbsp;</h3>
      <h3 class="sectionContentSubTitle">&nbsp;2. When you start in the Minecraft world the hunger bar is already pretty full meaning you can go quite a while before needing to find/ eat food. However, it is recommended to think ahead and find your source of food before that point. To do this you have to kill animals that are found roaming around the terrain&nbsp;</h3>
      <h3 class="sectionContentSubTitle">&nbsp;3.In Minecraft survival mode, a crafting table is essential because it allows you to create more complex items and tools. It gives you access to a larger crafting grid, which means you can combine different resources to make more advanced items. It's like having a bigger workspace to unleash your creativity!&nbsp;</h3>
      <h3 class="sectionContentSubTitle">&nbsp;4.Creating weapons is a crucial part of survival when it comes to survival mode in Minecraft. The zombies, endermans, and creepers are all enemies that are present within the terrain and they mainly come out at night so you will need to make weapons to defend yourself.&nbsp;</h3>
      <h3 class="sectionContentSubTitle">&nbsp;5. A light source is imperative when the sun goes down seeing as it gets really dark outside especially if you need to find food or shelter. </h3>
